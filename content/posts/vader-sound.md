Inspired by the Science Fiction sounds (R2D2, Red Alert) described in Andy Farnell's *Designing Sound* Part IV: Practicals, as well as the [Lightsaber Example](https://youtu.be/9DqBNDHKFC4?feature=shared) shown in my Computational Sound lecture, I sought out to recreate one of the most iconic, recognizable sounds from Science Fiction: Darth Vader's breathing.

### Experience the final result [here](https://sound.ethanmt.com/hw3/).
