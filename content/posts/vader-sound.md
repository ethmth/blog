Inspired by the sounds in Andy Farnell's _Designing Sound_ Part IV: Practicals, particularly the Science Fiction ones (R2D2, Red Alert), as well as the [Lightsaber Example](https://youtu.be/9DqBNDHKFC4?feature=shared) shown in my [Computational Sound](https://www.marksantolucito.com/COMS3430/spring2024/) lecture, I sought out to recreate one of the most iconic, recognizable sounds from Star Wars: Darth Vader's breathing.

**Experience the final result [here](https://sound.ethanmt.com/hw3/).**

## The Inhale {#the-inhale}

Darth Vader's breathing pattern can be split into two distinct parts: [The Inhale]({{< relref "#the-inhale" >}}) and [The Exhale]({{< relref "#the-exhale" >}}). Let's start with the inhale.
